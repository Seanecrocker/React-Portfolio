    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p className='about' >Ever since I was young, I’ve always enjoyed challenges that stimulate my brain. 
      I have a passion for problem-solving and creativity. In addition to being a software engineer, 
      I’m also a musician and music producer. I started playing piano at the age of three, and by four, 
      I was already gaming on the PC, learning to navigate complex tools early on.
    </p>

    <p className='about'>What ultimately led me to pursue a career in software engineering was my love for the meticulous process 
      of fitting puzzle pieces together, along with the creative freedom that comes from solving those puzzles and seeing the 
      bigger picture. I’m driven by a desire to continually improve my coding knowledge and skills as technology evolves.</p>
 
    <p className='about'>In my free time, I enjoy creating music, gaming, playing sports, and, of course, coding! Feel free to reach out via the contact page 
      if you’re interested in collaborating. (Click the github link at the bottom if you're interested in any of my other projects!)</p>
